# kube-killer

## Inspiration Burst

During the Cold War between one of my female friends / (ex-)girlfriends ( She said that we were done ) in these days , there was a crazy idea flashed through my mind:

**How about deleting ALL resources in production Kubernetes cluster environment ?**

Then I started to create such a **super Kubernetes virus**.

I would like to call it [kube-killer](https://github.com/p-program/kube-killer).

## What is it?

This is a tool helping you kill kubernetes‘s resource.

You can delete kubernetes‘s resource （deploy，pod，statefulset and so on） based on time schedule ⏰, 
custom metrics or custom condition.

`kube-killer` is a humane killer, he could freeze the deploy without killing it (scale to 0）.

It is very lightweight and easy to use, you don't need to install any CRD.

You could run as web server, binary and CLI mode.

## Architecture

A long run web server.

First of all,please make sure that:

1. You have a super MYSQL user. `root` is the best!
1. You are the administrator of the Kubernetes cluster. Admin of the “kube-system” is the best！

## Positive usage

You can create a scalable test environment by deleting those unused Kubernetes resources.

It is an another implement of “serverless”.

## Malicious usage

You can DELETE THE KEY RESOURCE SNEAKILY if your boss have no plan to raise your salary.

Please do not use it for bad (~~Although I bet you will~~).XD

Please remember one thing:

`Easy to hurt, hard to forgive, just make FUN.`

## Web server mode

## Binary mode

Once the server is ready，you can use the binary mode.

### kill resource

```go

```

### freeze deploy

```go

```

## CLI mode

Once the [kube-killer server](#Web-server-mode) is ready，you can use the CLI mode .

### kill resource

```bash
# delete "my-wife" deployment after 10 mins
kube-killer kill deploy my-wife -a 10m
kube-killer kill deployment my-wife -a 10m


# delete deployment by label
kube-killer kill deploy -l age=two-hundred
kube-killer kill deployment -l age=two-hundred

# delete deployment by namespace and labels
kube-killer kill deploy -l age=two-hundred -n default
kube-killer kill deployment -l age=two-hundred -n default

```

### freeze deploy

```bash
# scale “my-girlfriends” deployment’s spec.replicas to 0 now
kube-killer freeze deployment my-girlfriends -a
# scale “my-girlfriends” deployment’s spec.replicas to 0 after 1 hour
kube-killer freeze deployment my-girlfriends -a 1h

```

You can find more examples in my [test cases]()

## curl mode

You can expose the [kube-killer server](#Web-server-mode) by using nodePort service .

Then the [kube-killer server](#Web-server-mode) would become some kind of backdoor.

Finally，you are free to destroy the whole production Kubernetes cluster  remotely （Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh).

## TODO(NEVER DO)

1. kill namespace

## Confusion

Coding is easy, but it is really hard to figure out why she is so ANGRY.

Maybe I should tell her : DRINK MORE HOT WATER ?

What exactly does she want? Please tell me if you know the answer. Thank you very much！
