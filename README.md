# kube-killer

## Inspiration burst

During the Cold War between one of my female friends / (ex-)girlfriends ( She said that we were done ) in these days , there was a crazy idea flashed through my mind:

**How about deleting ALL resources in production Kubernetes cluster environment without reasons?**

So, I create such a **super Kubernetes virus**, I would like to call it [kube-killer](https://github.com/p-program/kube-killer).

## What is it?

ü§£ `kube-killer` is a tool helping you kill (unused) kubernetes‚Äòs resource.

You can delete kubernetes‚Äòs resource ÔºàdeployÔºåpodÔºåstatefulset and so onÔºâ based on time schedule ‚è∞,
 custom metrics or custom condition.

It is a humane killer, he could also freeze the deploy without killing it (scale to 0Ôºâ.

It is very lightweight and easy to use, you don't need to install any CRD.

You could run as web server, binary and CLI mode.

## Architecture

A long run web server using endless loop.

First of all,please make sure that:

1. You are the master of the MYSQL . `root` is the best! And you should make sure that the MYSQL database is reachable for the remote Kubernetes cluster.
1. You are the administrator of the Kubernetes cluster. Admin of the ‚Äúkube-system‚Äù will be the bestÔºÅ

## Positive usage

You can create a scalable test environment by deleting those unused Kubernetes resources.

It is an another implement of ‚Äúserverless‚Äù.

## Malicious usage

You can DELETE THE KEY RESOURCE SNEAKILY if your boss have no plan to raise your salary.

Please do not use it for bad . (ü§£~~Although I bet you will~~)

Remember:
`Easy to hurt, hard to forgive, just make FUN.`

## Web server mode

```bash
git clone https://github.com/p-program/kube-killer.git
make build
cp config-example.yaml config.yaml
# edit config.yaml depending on the actual situation
vi config.yaml
......
kube-killer init
```

It will create 


## Binary mode

Once the server is readyÔºåyou can use the binary mode.

### kill resource

```go

```

### freeze deploy

```go

```

## CLI mode

Once the [kube-killer server](#Web-server-mode) is readyÔºåyou can use the CLI mode .

### kill resource

```bash
# delete "my-wife" deployment after 10 mins
kube-killer kill deploy my-wife -a 10m
kube-killer kill deployment my-wife -a 10m


# delete deployment by label
kube-killer kill deploy -l age=two-hundred
kube-killer kill deployment -l age=two-hundred

# delete deployment by namespace and labels
kube-killer kill deploy -l age=two-hundred -n default
kube-killer kill deployment -l age=two-hundred -n default

```

### freeze deploy

```bash
# scale ‚Äúmy-girlfriends‚Äù deployment‚Äôs spec.replicas to 0 now
kube-killer freeze deployment my-girlfriends -a
# scale ‚Äúmy-girlfriends‚Äù deployment‚Äôs spec.replicas to 0 after 1 hour
kube-killer freeze deployment my-girlfriends -a 1h

```

You can find more examples in my [test cases]()

## curl mode

You can expose the [kube-killer server](#Web-server-mode) by using nodePort service .

Then the [kube-killer server](#Web-server-mode) would become some kind of backdoor.

FinallyÔºåyou are free to destroy the whole production Kubernetes cluster  remotely ÔºàHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh).

```bash
kube-killer kill zeusro
```

**!!!WARNING!!!**:PLEASE DO NOT USE.

It‚Äòs an unpredictable commandü§£.

## TODO(NEVER DO)

1. [ ] kube-killer prepare
    1. [ ] prepare MYSQL
    1. [ ] prepare kube-killer server
1. [ ] kill completed/failed pod automatically
1. [ ] kill unused volume ÔºàPV,PVC)
1. [ ] kill service without pod
1. [ ] kill stucking namespace
1. [ ] kill satan
1. [ ] kill zeusro
1. [ ] freeze resource
1. [ ] custom metrics condition support

## One more thing

Coding is easy, but it is really hard to figure out why she is so angry.

Should I tell her to DRINK MORE HOT WATER ?

What exactly does she want? Please tell me if you know the answer. Thank you very muchÔºÅ
